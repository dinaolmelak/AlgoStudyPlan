# One-Month AlgoExpert Study Plan

This is my 1 month study plan for becoming as proficient as possible through Algoexpert platform. 
I would like to give credit to [Chat](chat.openai.com) for this study guide. Thank you

## Week 1:
- Familiarize myself with the platform and available resources.
- Start with the "Easy" level questions: arrays, strings, and linked lists.
- Aim to solve 5-7 questions per day and review video explanations.

## Week 2:
- Dive deeper into complex topics: trees, graphs, and searching algorithms.
- Solve "Medium" level questions from AlgoExpert.
- Aim to solve 4-6 questions per day and understand underlying algorithms.

## Week 3:
- Focus on dynamic programming, recursion, and backtracking problems.
- Continue with "Medium" level questions, gradually transition to "Hard" level.
- Solve 3-5 questions per day, analyze optimal solutions and complexity.

## Week 4:
- Dedicate the week to solving challenging "Hard" level questions.
- Cover advanced topics like system design and concurrency (if comfortable).
- Solve 2-4 questions per day, review video explanations and solutions.

## Throughout the Month:
- Regularly review previously solved questions to reinforce understanding.
- Take note of common algorithms, data structures, and patterns.
- Implement solutions in your preferred programming language.
- Seek external resources or community assistance if needed.
